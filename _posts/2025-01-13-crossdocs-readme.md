> A powerful and lightweight cross-platform Markdown editor with real-time preview and AI assistance, built with Compose Multiplatform.


The vision behind CrossDocs is to make documentation a joy rather than a chore. By bringing together the power of real-time preview, AI assistance, and cross-platform compatibility, it's a tool that adapts to your workflow, not the other way around. Whether you're creating technical documentation, taking notes, or writing a blog post, CrossDocs gives you a distraction-free environment to focus on what matters most: your content.

What makes CrossDocs special is an understanding of how modern development flows work. This application is made with Compose Multiplatform. It has native performance on any platform while also providing a smooth user experience across all of them. The integration of Google's Gemini AI is no feature checkbox it's a considered implementation that assists you in writing better, faster, and with more accuracy.
